<h1>Network Relay</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
CuckooNET is the official home of #distributed, the distributed.net IRC channel.
#distributed has migrated to CuckooNET from efnet, where it has lived since January
1997.  In order to ease the transition, #distributed (and the various other
distributed.net channels) are currently dual-homed on both efnet and CuckooNET.
</p>
<p>
The dctirelay bot exists on both networks and relays channel traffic between the
two networks.  This allows users on either network the simplest method of cross-network
communication.
</p>

<h2>Simplifying Use</h2>
<p>
The scripts below will make the relay less obtrusive.  Since IRC display and formatting
is a very personal aspect of your client configuration, there are several flavors of 
script for some IRC client software.  Please experiment to see which style best suits
you.
</p>

  <h2>BitchX</h2>
  <pre>
    # these triggers make the efnet<-->cuckoonet dctirelay operation
    # more transparent.  users on the other side of the relay are only
    # distinguishable by the color of the line now.
    #
    # ditch the "[$Z]" parts if you don't use timestamps.

    on ^public "dctirelay %" {
      /echo [$Z]$2 $3-
    }
    on ^action "dctirelay %" {
      /echo [$Z]<$4->
    }

       - nugget@distributed.net
  </pre>

  <h2>epic</h2>
  <pre>
    on ^public "dctirelay #distributed *" {xecho -w $winchan($1) $2-}
    on ^action "dctirelay #distributed indicates that *" {xecho -w $winchan($1) * $4-}

       - Q-

    on ^1:ACTION:*indicates that*:#distributed: if ($nick == dctirelay) { /echo #distributed * $3- | haltdef }

       - Lithron

    on ^1:TEXT:<*>*:#distributed:if ($nick == dctirelay) { /echo -t #distributed $1- | haltdef }
    on ^1:ACTION:*indicates that*:#distributed: if ($nick == dctirelay) { /echo 6 -t #distributed * $3- | haltdef }

       - Alternate syntax from Sponge with color/timestamp support

    on ^1:TEXT:<*>*:#:if ($nick == dctirelay) { /echo -t [ $chan ] D $+ $1-  | haltdef }
    on ^1:ACTION:*indicates that*:#: if ($nick == dctirelay) { /echo 6 -t [ $chan ] D $+ * $3- | haltdef }

       - Froggie (prefixes all irc.d.net messages with a single D and
                  not limited to just #distributed.)
